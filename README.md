## Live Pitch
This was the first iteration of a multiplayer expeince. User's could use the WIN Reality app to send pitches to a player in VR to hit against.

Responsibilities: Design, VR UI/UX, Led the feature from proof of concept to release 

## Feed.fm Music Streaming
I design and implemented a music player that integrated with Feed.fm's API. Users were able to choose from a list of stations and could skip, play/pause, and adjust volume. Users could use this in the menu while pointing with the quest controller, or could interact using their bat on the field.

Responsibilities: Design, Implementation in C#, UI/UX, Integration with 3rd Party API

## Dynamic Bat Visuals
I designed and implemented a system enabling the creation of new bats by predetermined types such as wood or metal, dictating their distinct mesh design and triggering specific audio events.
